A modern C++ game framework for 2D games, written in C++20.

## Background

This framework was originally developed from the custom engine built for the
[Wanderer](https://github.com/albin-johansson/wanderer) indie game, developed by me. This framework
is also closely tied to the [Centurion](https://github.com/albin-johansson/centurion) library.

## Dependencies
